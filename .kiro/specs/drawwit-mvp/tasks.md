## Notes for Fast Development

- **Module 1 Priority**: Focus on getting the visual design working first, then connect endpoints
- **MVP Approach**: Implement core functionality without advanced features initially
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component in Devvit playtest environment as you build
- **Placeholder Data**: Use mock data initially, replace with Redis integration progressively
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile screens since most Reddit users are on mobile devices
