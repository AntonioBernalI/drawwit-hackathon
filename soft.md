## Prompt for Pixel Canvas Painting Screen

Create a modern, vibrant mobile UI design for a pixel art drawing app called "drawwit" with the following specifications:

**Resolution:** 375x551 pixels (mobile portrait)

**Layout Requirements:**

- **Top Section (Header):** Display the drawing prompt name prominently in a stylish font
- **Upvotes Display:** Show upvote count with Reddit-style upvote arrow icon
- **Ink Counter:** Display player's remaining ink/paint amount with a paint drop or brush icon
- **Main Canvas Area:** Large central pixel grid canvas (approximately 60% of screen height)
- **Color Palette:** Bottom section with vibrant color swatches arranged in a grid
- **Custom Color Option:** Include a "+" button or color picker icon for custom colors

**Visual Style:**

- **Full pixel art aesthetic** - everything should be rendered in pixel art style
- Dark theme with neon accent colors (purple, cyan, pink)
- Chunky, pixelated UI elements and borders
- **Pincel/brush-based painting** - show pixel brushes/pincels as the painting tool, not stroke-based drawing
- Retro gaming/8-bit inspired interface design
- Pixelated fonts and icons throughout

**Color Palette Should Include:**

- Primary colors: Red, Blue, Yellow
- Secondary colors: Green, Orange, Purple
- Neutral colors: Black, White, Gray
- Neon/bright variants for digital art appeal

**UI Elements:**

- **Pixelated buttons** with chunky, retro game-style design
- **Pixel art typography** (8-bit style fonts)
- Clear pixel grid on the canvas showing individual pixels
- **Pincel/brush tools** visible - show pixel brushes of different sizes
- **Pixel art icons** for all interface elements (upvote arrows, paint drops, etc.)
- Mobile-optimized touch targets with pixel art styling

**Painting Method:**

- **Pincel/brush-based pixel painting** - users paint individual pixels using brush tools
- Show different brush/pincel sizes (1x1, 2x2, 3x3 pixel brushes)
- **NOT stroke-based drawing** - emphasize pixel-by-pixel placement
- Include brush selection UI with pixelated brush icons

**Additional Details:**

- **Everything rendered in pixel art style** - no smooth modern elements
- Suitable for Reddit's retro gaming community
- Emphasize the social/competitive aspect with pixelated upvote display
- Include subtle Reddit branding elements in pixel art style
- Ensure all pixel art text is readable and UI elements are clearly distinguishable
- Show the painting process as placing individual colored pixels with brushes/pincels
